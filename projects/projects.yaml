  tagline: This site! I developed the site from scratch built in svelte kit.
  description: >-
    I built this site in Svelte kit to compile statically to be deployed. My
    project list _(all of the projects you see in this gallery)_ are stored in a
    "Yet Another Markup Language" (yaml) file. I built an editor around this
    file so in development mode I can edit projects from an intuitive and easy
    to use editor. You can take a look at the editor by going to the linked
    github repo, cloning it, and running:

    1. `pnpm install`

    2. `pnpm build`

    3. `pnpm dev` (you can see this editor by going to
    [http://localhost:5173/editor](http://localhost:5173/editor) now!)
