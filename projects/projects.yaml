    tagline: This site! I developed the site from scratch built in svelte kit.
    description: >-
      I built this site in Svelte kit to compile statically to be deployed. My
      project list _(all of the projects you see in this gallery)_ are stored in
      a "Yet Another Markup Language" (yaml) file. I built an editor around this
      file so in development mode I can edit projects from an intuitive and easy
      to use editor. You can take a look at the editor by going to the linked
      github repo, cloning it, and running:

      1. `pnpm install`

      2. `pnpm build`

      3. `pnpm dev` (you can see this editor by going to
      [http://localhost:5173/editor](http://localhost:5173/editor) now!)

    name: Pumpkin Smash
    tagline: >-
      Built & designed an 8 foot tall guillotine to smash pumpkins at my city's
      annual pumpkin composting event 
    description: >-
      Each year, the LigerBots, my FIRST Robotics team, design and build a
      pumpkin smasher for Newton's annual Pumpkin Smash composting event. In
      2024, I proposed, designed, and led the build of an eight-foot-tall
      guillotine to smash pumpkins for composting. I created the design in
      Onshape, taught teammates to use woodworking and power tools, and
      coordinated a team of about twenty students through construction. The
      guillotine both entertained the community and sped up composting, turning
      pumpkin waste into soil while showcasing engineering, leadership, and
      sustainability in action.

    name: Little Free Library
    tagline: Designed and built a Little Free Library from scratch in Tinker CAD
    description: >-
      I designed a Little Free Library from scratch using TinkerCAD, the first
      CAD software I learned. After completing the design, I gathered materials
      and taught myself to use power tools such as a table saw, drill, and
      pneumatic nail gun to build it. Wanting to do the job right, I reached out
      to people in my community and found some who had recently re-roofed their
      houses and were willing to share leftover shingles. I purchased tar mat
      and drip edge from Home Depot and constructed the roof just like a real
      house. For the front, I wanted a full-sized window, so I built a custom
      frame with slots and repurposed an acrylic face shield to create a large,
      clear window. Several years later, it still stands strong, having endured
      many wind and snow storms.
