    name: Personal Website
    tagline: This site! Built from the ground up in SvelteKit.
    description: >-
      The site you’re looking at is built in SvelteKit, a lightweight web
      framework. I chose Svelte because I wanted to improve my skills with it
      and create something unique. I also wanted more flexibility to customize
      my site. Another reason for this approach was so I could store all my
      projects in a single file, which I could later reuse if, for example, I
      decide to redo the site.


      All of the projects you see in this gallery are stored in a “Yet Another
      Markup Language” (YAML) file, a human-editable text format that machines
      can also read. I built an editor around this file, so in development mode,
      I can manage projects through an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. You
      can check out the editor by visiting the linked GitHub repo and following
      the setup instructions.


      When I was testing out my site for speed with a simulated slow network, I
      found that it took over 20 seconds to load some of the images. I then made
      an automation to solve this which will automatically compress my images
      with Image Magick (a command line tool for manipulating images) by a
      factor of 10-20x without significant quality compromise.

    tagline: >-
      Organized and ran a 12-hour hackathon at the Microsoft NERD Center with 60
      teen attendees. | Fourth Hackathon Organized
    description: >-
      I organized a 60-person Boston Daydream Hackathon, part of a global series
      with 100 simultaneous events. I led a team of organizers and secured a
      donated venue. I also handled teacher and student outreach to recruit
      attendees. To help train the next generation of organizers, I made the
      planning process open encouraged more teens to contribute, with the goal
      of enabling teens to run future events after I graduate high school.

      Third Hackathon Organized
    description: >-
      I once had the wild idea of running a hackathon on an island. A year
      later, I spent the entire summer at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com)
      bringing that idea to life by organizing a four-day hackathon at the
      Cathleen Stone Outward Bound School on Thompson Island in Boston Harbor. I
      helped coordinate the event for 120 participants, securing $130K in
      funding, handling logistics, recruiting attendees, and keeping everything
      running smoothly while learning a lot about teamwork, planning, and what
      it takes to turn an ambitious idea into reality.

    tagline: >-
      Organized and ran a 12-hour hackathon at the Microsoft NERD Center with 60
      teen attendees. | Second Hackathon Organized
    description: >-
      I organized a 60-person Boston Scrapyard Hackathon, part of a global
      series with 75 simultaneous events. I led a team of organizers, raised
      $1K, and secured a donated venue. I also handled teacher and student
      outreach to recruit attendees. I also took the marketing materials from my
      previous hackathon project, Counterspell, and made them more generic so
      they could be easily reused for future hackathons.


      After a tedious check-in experience at Counterspell Boston, I decided to
      build a QR code-based check-in system and send QR codes to attendees in
      advance. To keep the system flexible, I used Google Sheets as the
      database, allowing us to manually verify waiver completions and check
      people in if they couldn’t access their QR code.

    name: QR Code Check-in Web App
    tagline: 'A flexible, easy to use, QR code check-in app for events. '
    description: >-
      After a tedious check-in experience at the first hackathon I ran, I
      decided to build a QR code-based check-in system and send QR codes to
      attendees in advance. To keep the system flexible, I used Google Sheets as
      the database, allowing us to manually verify waiver completions and check
      people in if they couldn’t access their QR code.


      I created a website that securely shares credentials for the user-friendly
      check-in scanner page, so multiple people can help sign attendees in. If
      someone hasn’t completed their forms, the system automatically sends them
      an email with instructions on how to submit them and what to do afterward.
      Oh, and did I mention it automatically marks people as present in a
      human-editable Google Sheet for those inevitable edge cases? The entire
      project revolves around Google Sheets: once attendee data is added, a
      mail-merge-style spreadsheet is generated, making it easy to send
      personalized emails with each attendee’s QR code.

    name: Pumpkin Smash
    tagline: >-
      Built & designed an 8 foot tall guillotine to smash pumpkins at my city's
      annual pumpkin composting event 
    description: >-
      Each year, the LigerBots, my FIRST Robotics team, design and build a
      pumpkin smasher for Newton's annual Pumpkin Smash composting event. In
      2024, I proposed, designed, and led the build of an eight-foot-tall
      guillotine to smash pumpkins for composting. I created the design in
      Onshape, taught teammates to use woodworking and power tools, and
      coordinated a team of about twenty students through construction. The
      guillotine both entertained the community and sped up composting, turning
      pumpkin waste into soil while showcasing engineering, leadership, and
      sustainability in action.

    name: Apocalypse Hackathon Device
    tagline: >-
      Peer-to-peer communication device built for an apocalypse-themed
      hackathon.
    description: >-
      Infromedead is a set of devices that can communicate with each other off
      the grid!


      The prompt for Apocalypse was to create something to help you survive the
      zombie apocalypse. We thought that since the internet would be unreliable
      during the apocalypse, it would be helpful to have devices that allow you
      to communicate regardless!


      The code runs on ESP32s, and the devices work by each setting up their own
      WiFi access points. From there, if a device wants to send a message, it
      simply connects to the access point of the one it's sending to and sends
      its message via the WiFi.


      All the inputs come from the keypads connected to the ESP32s which are set
      up somewhat like phone keypads, allowing the user to type any letter or
      number.

    name: Off the Grid Communicator Circuit Board
    tagline: >-
      Built off the grid texting device for a hackathon on the Pacific Crest
      Trail, without cell service
    description: >-
      I had an idea for building a texting device for a seven-day off-the-grid
      hike. I enlisted a small team of friends excited by the idea, and we
      worked on a circuit board and firmware project to bring it to life. I
      learned how to design a circuit board for the first time using EasyEDA,
      designed most of the board, and optimized it for long-lasting battery life
      so it could run for eight days of constant use. I also designed it for far
      ranged communications having it communicate over a mile without cell
      towers or any external infrastructure. We got it manufactured in China and
      distributed about 20 units for the other hikers in our group to use during
      the hike. I also programmed the board from scratch and gained hands-on
      experience soldering while assembling the components. Throughout the
      project, I collaborated closely with my friends on both the design and
      software, learning a great deal about electronics and teamwork.

    name: Little Free Library
    tagline: Designed and built a Little Free Library from scratch in Tinker CAD
    description: >-
      I designed a Little Free Library from scratch using TinkerCAD, the first
      CAD software I learned. After completing the design, I gathered materials
      and taught myself to use power tools such as a table saw, drill, and
      pneumatic nail gun to build it. Wanting to do the job right, I reached out
      to people in my community and found some who had recently re-roofed their
      houses and were willing to share leftover shingles. I purchased tar mat
      and drip edge from Home Depot and constructed the roof just like a real
      house. For the front, I wanted a full-sized window, so I built a custom
      frame with slots and repurposed an acrylic face shield to create a large,
      clear window. Several years later, it still stands strong, having endured
      many wind and snow storms.
